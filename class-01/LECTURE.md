# Class 01: Orientation and Node / Testing / Code Challenges

## Introductions

* What is your name?
* What is your dream job?

## Course Mechanics

### Canvas

Our classroom management portal

### Assignments

**Everyday (Monday through Thursday)**

* Reading - Due by midnight the day it's due (I recommend completing before the lecture on he day it's assigned).
* Lab - Due by midnight (Submit something before the next class starts)
* Code Challenge - Due by midnight (Try tto get something turned in before you start on the lab)
* Learning Journal - Please do these before the start of the next class.

**Every Friday**

* Mornings will be our Career Coaching Workshop (Resumes, job search, inerview prep, personal pitch).
* Data Structure Implementation: introduce you to design patterns and problem solving techiniques that the industry. ( Linked Lists this Friday )
* Partner Power Hour!!
  * These are networking opportunities.
* No Lab!!!

**Late Work**: Will receive 20 percent deduction in points. (this is here not to make things difficult, this is just here to help you adopt a workflow similar to the industry.)

### Github

This is where all the content will be published. To receive tha content you will need to do the following:

1) Fork the class repository: https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d44
2) Clone the fork of the respository!
3) Add an `upstream`!
   1) Go back to the original class repo and grab the github link.
   2) From the terminal, within your forked repo: run `git remote add upstream git@github.com:codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d44.git`
   3) Run `git pull upstream main` to get any published updates to the curriculum.

## DEMO

### Code Challenges / Data Structure Implementations

* Always have a README in your code challenge directory
  * Explain the challenge in your own words
  * Talk about your solution
  * Include and links / embedded images to your whiteboard.
  * Talk about any details you think are necessary for the challenge.

### TDD (Test Drive Development / Node)

* Node Runtime.
  * What is a runtime?
    * This is a place for code to run.
    * Most of the time JS runs in the browser
      * prompt
      * document.getElementById
      * These are all things provided by our runtime.
    * Node has a completely seperate set of concerns:
      * What's in your file system.
      * What's input is coming from the terminal.
      * We are concerned heavily with requests from other machines.
* Jest / test runners
* Node Module pattern.

### Express Server Basics

How to think about systems that fulfill requests, and about diagramming "behaviors".

* We want to fulfill HTTP requests.
* Our server needs to response appropriately.
